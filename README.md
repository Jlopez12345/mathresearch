# Mutated Gene Analysis in Cancer Tumors - Mathematics research

Throught the mathematics department at St.Edwards University, I have had the opportunity to do research with the guidance of my professor Dr. Savala. Together we have been able to combine a series of different files that inlcude mutation information for patients with different cancer typpes. Using the following files as listed below.

## Tools used
- R programming
- Statistical tests, including:
	- Chi- Square
	- Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test

## Biology topics covered
- Genes
- Mutations
- Cancer
- Obesity
- Cancer & Obesity
