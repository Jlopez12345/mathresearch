# Mutated Gene Analysis in Cancer Tumors - Mathematics research

Through the mathematics department at St.Edwards University, I have had the opportunity to do research with the guidance of  professor Dr. Savala. Together we have been able to combine a series of different files gathered from the online database BROAD GDAC Firehose which inlcudes mutation information for patients with different cancer types. Below is breakdown of the work I have done so far from the presentations given to the working R files that collected the information and brought it all together. 

## Tools used
- R programming
- Statistical tests, including:
	- Chi- Square
	- Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test

## Biology topics covered
- Genes
- Mutations
- Cancer
- Obesity
- Cancer & Obesity
